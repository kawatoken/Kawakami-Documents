Based on a rare breed of japanese dog, itself a descendent of wolves, Kawakami exemplifies the traits of integrity, vision, and teamwork. As such these values undercut every move that we make. INTEGRITY, by leading with humility and taking the community’s input seriously and always striving to do what’s best for all members of the family. VISION, by striving to create solutions and be a step ahead of the industry and to set the trends rather than follow them. And finally, TEAMWORK, with such big goals it requires a team effort to ensure that deadlines are met and the job is done right, together we are stronger than individually. 

These are the values that will guide the ethos of Kawakami and upon which we strive to create the most inclusive, loyal, and serving community in the sector. In addition, we always strive to be transparent, receptive and committed to the cause no matter what difficulties arise. We believe that this approach is the key for longevity - not only for Kawakami and KAWA - but the entire sector of community oriented tokens.
