The goal of the Kawakami ecosystem is to create a new, modern, and state-of-the-art platform dedicated solely to the growth of meme tokens. With the critical role that meme tokens have played thus far since the bull run in 2021 (and likely ones to follow), the community has decided to pursue multiple product offerings, including:

## KawaTools
Our flagship product KawaTools (currently in development) will be designed to provide data-driven resources catering to the meme token investors, as well as meme projects. We are building a first of its kind central hub for everything a meme token investor needs, as well as all the tools meme project launches need to reach their audience (not to be confused with a project launchpad - we will not be facilitating meme token launches). It will be a feature-packed app helping investors make educated decisions on which tokens are good investments and whether they are safe to invest in. Some of the tools that will be included in the KawaTools include:

- Charts: Token charting tool packed with real-time token information, with a standard set of features but also some innovative ones specifically built with a meme token investor in mind.
- KawaSwap: A custom-built DEX (decentralized exchange), which will also be built into the Charts section so you can trade while looking at the charts.
- KawaDAO: A DAO tool where KAWA holders can submit proposals and accept or decline team- and user-submitted proposals. This also ties into the following tool.
- KawaSeed: A venture capital fund enabling the Kawakami community to vote on and invest in early stage cryptocurrency project start ups, with returns being distributed back to the community. 
- Security hub: A tool allowing you to do quick analysis of token contracts to verify if there is any malicious code.
- NFTs and Metaverse: We are releasing a KAWA NFT collection that will be usable as a PFP NFT but also connected to a metaverse we aim to build in 2023. The NFTs will also be used as part of the KawaTools app, and will in combination with holding the KAWA token allow users to gain access to the most advanced features of the toolkit. More information about the NFT collection and their utility in the Kawakami ecosystem will be available in a separate NFT whitepaper and our brand new NFT website.

As we reach important project development milestones, this section of the whitepaper will be updated to keep our community informed.
