The v3 of the $KAWA token contract was launched on February 23, 2022. Learning from the mistakes from the previous two token contracts, the v3 contract was built with some of the best security and optimization (gas efficiency) measures allowing investors to trade in a safe and efficient manner.

**Token trade tax**

&#8594; Buy tax: 5% (4% used for business operations*, 1% is paid to the contract developer). \
&#8594; Sell tax: 9% (8% used for business operations*, 1% is paid to the contract developer).

**Note:** Sell tax is hardcoded at 9% and cannot be modified. Buy tax is hard capped at 5% and can be lowered to 0% but cannot exceed 5%.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * *Includes marketing activities, business development, salaries, token buybacks.*

KAWA is the native token of the Kawakami project and products. KAWA is an ERC20 token which was created in May 2021 as a fair launch with no presale, and no team allocation. Since then weâ€™ve had two contract migrations, making the current token version 3.

With regards to the utility of the KAWA token, it is intended that every Kawakami ecosystem component will be designed to involve KAWA, either directly (e.g. within the product) or indirectly (e.g. via a buy back and burn mechanism), thus, generating consistent price support for the KAWA token.
