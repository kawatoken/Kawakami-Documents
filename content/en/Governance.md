Kawakami is fully decentralized, meaning as a community member, you call the shots as to what the future of the project will look like. We value “idea meritocracy”, listening and acting upon all the best ideas, no matter where they come from. Best of all, Kawakami is completely inclusive and willing to accept anyone who wants to join its ever-growing family.

It is with these values in mind that we have created KawaDAO, the core governance structure for Kawakami. Although the team are dedicated to establishing a solid foundation for the project, they also recognize the importance of upholding the standard of decentralization and will hand
over control of the project’s future to the community in due course. To do this a third party end-to-end Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) platform will be utilized to enable our community of investors to create and vote on proposals regarding the governance of Kawakami. Eligibility to participate in voting procedures will be granted by holding our native token, KAWA.

KawaDAO currently runs on Snapshot, a gasless voting platform that allows for on-chain execution via SafeSnap, the Gnosis Snapshot Plugin. More can be read about SafeSnap here. We plan to migrate to a more robust DAO platform in the future in order to allow for complete governance of contract and treasury decisions.

While multi-chain governance would be the ideal scenario for KawaDAO, this technology is not yet available.
