Kawakami was formed by a core team from all corners of the globe, with a range of different cultures, backgrounds and experiences. One thing unites them: a love of memecoins. All successful pioneers in the memecoin investment niche, the Kawakami team have combined their experiences in the spaces of cryptocurrency, financial services, digital marketing and consumer relations to develop a cryptocurrency project like no other.

Kawakami, as a project, is no stranger to challenges and is backed by a team with an unrelenting hunger for improvement and innovation. Since Kawakamiâ€™s creation in May 2021 we have rebooted the token structure twice, each time ensuring that the updated tokenomics are better than the last. Each reboot has provided additional benefits to our community and allowed us to develop the best foundation for us to thrive in the cryptosphere for the long term.
