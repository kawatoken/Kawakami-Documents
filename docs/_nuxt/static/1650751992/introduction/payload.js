Among the new trends that emerged, one brand new asset class made a big splash - meme tokens. While the number of new dog and other, usually animal-based, tokens skyrocketed, it became clear there was very little difference between them. Rarely did one display a true use case, and the extent of token differentiation seemed to begin and end at branding; success was largely determined by a popularity contest."}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Enter Kawakami — a one-of-a-kind community-driven memecoin initiative that flips this concept on its head, leading with utility and purpose driven products set to serve the growing market of memecoins and their communities. As such, Kawakami is both a memecoin and a tech company providing an innovative platform for other tokens to address their own lack of “utility” and offer more value to their holders. Partnering with Kawakami will offer the tools and resources needed to go from “hype-based” to “utility-fueled” with a range of DeFi (decentralized finance) products in development such as a platform offering data-driven resources for meme token investors, yield farming, P2E gaming, NFTs and integration into the Metaverse.
